# jumpy-demo
cocos2d-x testing and demonstration. To put it short, make rabbits jump and dodge bees.

One week of coding after kids are asleep. No previous cocos2d-x knowledge. Not intended for display of best practices, learning by doing and no time for refactoring or proper design. There are no future plans.

# Build instructions
TBH I'm not sure what is required, and I do not have time to really find out. Since cocos2d is part of the build environment, I would suspect that Windows build works out of the box by checking out the repository and opening a solution under proj.win32 directory.

# Game instructions
Touch bunny and it jumps. Touch the bunny again while upwards motion and it double jumps. Touch it again while downads motion and there's a small dash. Use these tools to dodge bees, one hit is enough to quit the stage.
